      <h3>§ 1 General Terms - Scope of Application</h3>

      <ol>
        <li>
          These General Terms and Conditions of Business (in German: Allgemeine Geschäftsbedingungen, AGB) shall apply
          to all of our business relations with our customers (hereinafter referred to as "Buyer"). The Conditions shall
          only apply if the Buyer is an entrepreneur, a legal entity under public law, or a special fund under public
          law.
        </li>

        <li>
          The General Terms and Conditions of Business shall in particular apply to contracts for the sale and/or
          delivery of digital products, irrespective of whether we manufacture the products ourselves or procure them
          from suppliers. The General Terms and Conditions of Business in their current version shall also apply as a
          framework agreement to future contracts for the sale and/or the delivery of digital products with the same
          Buyer without our having to refer to them again in every single case. In the case of amendments of these
          General Terms and Conditions of Business, the Buyer shall be notified without delay.
        </li>

        <li>
          Our General Terms and Conditions of Business shall exclusively apply. Deviating, contradictory, or
          supplementary General Terms and Conditions of a Buyer shall only become part of the contract if and insofar as
          we have given our express consent. This requirement of consent shall apply in any event, even if, for
          instance, we unconditionally deliver products to the Buyer in awareness of the latter's General Terms and
          Conditions of Business.
        </li>

        <li>
          Individual agreements concluded with the Buyer on a case-to-case basis (including collateral agreements,
          supplements, and amendments) shall in all instances have precedence over these General Terms and Conditions of
          Business. A written contract or our written confirmation shall be decisive for the validity of such
          agreements.
        </li>

        <li>
          Legally relevant declarations and notifications rendered to us by the Buyer after the conclusion of the
          contract (such as setting of deadlines, notifications of defects, declaration of cancellation or reduction)
          shall only be valid if made in writing.
        </li>

        <li>
          References to the applicability of legal provisions are provided for clarification purposes only.
          Consequently, even without such clarifying references, legal provisions shall be applicable unless directly
          amended or expressly excluded in these General Terms and Conditions of Business.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3>§ 2 Conclusion of Contract</h3>

      <ol>
        <li>
          Our offers are non-binding and subject to change. This also applies if we have provided the Buyer with
          catalogs, technical documentation (e.g., drawings, plans, calculations, references to DIN standards), other
          product descriptions, or documents – also in electronic form – to which we reserve ownership and copyright.
        </li>

        <li>
          The order of the products by the Buyer shall be deemed a binding contractual offer. Unless otherwise stated in
          the order, we are entitled to accept this contractual offer within 14 days of its receipt by us.
        </li>

        <li>
          Acceptance can be declared either in writing (e.g., by order confirmation) or by delivering the products to
          the Buyer.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3>§ 3 Subscription Plans and Payment</h3>

      <div>
        <h3>§ 3 Subscription Plans and Payment</h3>

        <ol>
          <li>
            We offer two subscription plans for our digital product "Remind5":

            <ul>
              <li>Free Plan: Free of charge.</li>
              <li>
                Supporter Plan: $1 per month. The Supporter plan does not include any additional features compared to
                the Free Plan.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>

          <li>
            Payment for the Supporter plan is due monthly in advance. The Buyer can choose to pay via credit card or
            other payment methods provided on our Site.
          </li>

          <li>
            In the event of a declined payment for the Supporter plan, the Buyer will be notified and must provide an
            alternative payment method. If payment is not received within 10 days, we reserve the right to suspend
            access to the Supporter plan benefits until payment is made.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3>§ 4 Delivery and Performance</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          The delivery of digital products shall be made electronically to the email address or account specified by the
          Buyer.
        </li>

        <li>
          The risk of accidental loss and accidental deterioration of the digital products shall pass to the Buyer upon
          delivery.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3>§ 5 User Obligations</h3>

      <ol>
        <li>
          The Buyer agrees to use the digital products only for lawful purposes and in accordance with these Terms and
          Conditions.
        </li>

        <li>
          The Buyer shall not: <br />

          <ul>
            <li>
              Use the digital products in any way that breaches any applicable local, national, or international law or
              regulation.
            </li>

            <li>
              Use the digital products for any purpose that is unlawful or fraudulent, or has any unlawful or fraudulent
              purpose or effect.
            </li>

            <li>
              Reproduce, duplicate, copy, or re-sell any part of our digital products in contravention of the provisions
              of these Terms and Conditions.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3>§ 6 Limitation of Liability</h3>

      <ol>
        <li>
          We shall only be liable for compensation, irrespective of legal ground, in the event of intent and gross
          negligence. In the case of ordinary negligence, we shall only be liable for:

          <ul>
            <li>Damages resulting from injury to life, body, or health.</li>

            <li>
              Damages resulting from the breach of an essential contractual obligation (an obligation whose fulfillment
              is a prerequisite for the proper execution of the contract and on whose compliance the contractual partner
              regularly relies and may rely). In this case, however, our liability shall be limited to the compensation
              of the foreseeable, typically occurring damage.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
          The limitations of liability resulting from § 6.1 shall not apply if we have fraudulently concealed a defect
          or have assumed a guarantee for the quality of the goods. The same applies to claims of the Buyer under the
          Product Liability Act.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3>§ 7 Data Protection</h3>

      <ol>
        <li>
          The Buyer may terminate the subscription at any time with effect from the end of the current subscription
          period.
        </li>

        <li>We may terminate the subscription with a notice period of 30 days to the end of a calendar month.</li>

        <li>The right to terminate for cause remains unaffected.</li>
      </ol>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3>§ 9 Dispute Resolution</h3>

      <ol>
        <li>
          In the event of any disputes arising out of or in connection with this contract, the parties shall attempt to
          resolve the dispute amicably through negotiation.
        </li>

        <li>
          If the dispute cannot be resolved through negotiation, the parties agree to consider mediation before
          resorting to litigation.
        </li>

        <li>
          If mediation fails, the exclusive place of jurisdiction for all disputes arising from this contract shall be
          our registered office, provided the Buyer is a merchant, a legal entity under public law, or a special fund
          under public law.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3>§ 10 Choice of Law and Venue</h3>

      <ol>
        <li>
          These General Terms and Conditions of Business and all legal relations between us and the Buyer shall be
          governed by the law of the Federal Republic of Germany to the exclusion of international uniform law, in
          particular the UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods.
        </li>

        <li>
          If the Buyer is a merchant as defined by the German Commercial Code, a legal entity under public law, or a
          special fund under public law, the exclusive and also international place of jurisdiction for all disputes
          arising indirectly or directly from the contractual relationship shall be our registered office. We shall,
          however, also be entitled to file a suit at the Buyer’s place of general jurisdiction.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3>§ 11 Final Provisions</h3>

      <ol>
        <li>
          Should individual provisions of these General Terms and Conditions be or become invalid, this shall not affect
          the validity of the remaining provisions.
        </li>

        <li>
          The invalid provision shall be replaced by a valid provision that comes closest to the economic purpose of the
          invalid provision.
        </li>

        <li>
          Amendments and supplements to these General Terms and Conditions must be made in writing. This also applies to
          the waiver of the written form requirement.
        </li>
      </ol>
